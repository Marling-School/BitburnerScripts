/**
 * Given an array of array of numbers representing a 2D matrix, return the
elements of that matrix in clockwise spiral order.

Example: The spiral order of

[1, 2, 3, 4]
[5, 6, 7, 8]
[9, 10, 11, 12]

is [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9, 5, 6, 7]
 * 
 * Given the following array of arrays of numbers representing a 2D matrix, return the elements of the matrix as an array in spiral order:

    [
        [21,48,22,47,25,39,20]
        [25,26,31,13,15,34,23]
        [46,44,21,45,44,13,24]
        [34,22,11, 8,27, 6,31]
        [ 2,16,31,23,42,22,50]
        [43,20,12,38,44,45,30]
        [19,42, 5,23,44,50,27]
        [41,41,13,30, 9,24,36]
        [12,48,44,41,39,20,47]
        [ 5,35,11,32,13, 7,47]
        [ 3, 7,14,30, 8,15,43]
        [32,43,46, 6,50,42,42]
        [11,33,29,39,42,20,26]
    ]

Here is an example of what spiral order should be:

     [
         [1, 2, 3]
         [4, 5, 6]
         [7, 8, 9]
     ]

 Answer: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8 ,7, 4, 5]

 Note that the matrix will not always be square:

     [
         [1,  2,  3,  4]
         [5,  6,  7,  8]
         [9, 10, 11, 12]
     ]

 * @param {NS} ns 
 * @param {*} data 
 * @returns 
 */

export function spiralizeMatrix(ns, data) {

    return [];
}
